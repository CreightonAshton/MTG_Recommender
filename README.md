## Problem Statement

Building a deck in Magic can be difficult. There have been nearly 20,000 different tournament-legal cards printed throughout the history of the game. I will use data on Magic: the Gathering cards to build a content-based recommender system that suggests similar cards in order to improve card selection during the deck building process.
